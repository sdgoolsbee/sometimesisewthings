I had an unexpectedly productive sewing weekend! I didn’t really plan on doing much of anything for my store, but things happen. Lee and his brother were planning to see a movie on Saturday afternoon and I was going to run some errands and go shopping, but when we went to leave, our car battery was dead… I suppose that is what happens when you leave the headlights on all night. Instead, Lee got a ride and I stayed home and completely prepped two sets of placemats and actually completed one of them. This super cute mini set is a custom order for my cousin!

I’ll finish the other set if I can ever find some green thread to match these to finish them up! At least I think it’s green. My husband says its yellow/gold. That discrepancy might be part of the problem!

I did something a little out of my comfort zone yesterday! I went to a sewing meetup nearby. We all made these little boxed zipper pouches. Mine turned out so cute; I am going to need to make a bunch more in different sizes.

Update on our living room progress: we painted the wall the right color!! It looks great! We also ordered light fixtures this weekend, so we are getting closer!

Be looking for all new pictures on my store towards the end of the week! I have a few projects to finish up before I start that process, but I want to get them taken this week!
