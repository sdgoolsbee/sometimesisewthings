Boy time is just flying by. I haven't been able to do nearly as much in the first 2 months of the year as I hoped to, but I did hit a few big milestones! In January, I got my 100th sale! I also experienced the first time I've ever gotten 3 orders in one day! Between work, fulfilling orders, and making some personal gifts I've kept pretty busy, so I haven't been able to do as much in the way of new products as I had hoped. Oh well. I'm hoping that now that I am caught up, I'll be able to spend some time this weekend and next week working on that. 

I was able to go to Dallas a few weeks ago and spend some time with my family and hang out with my sister a bit before she has her baby in April. It was such a nice visit! No real plans, aside from her baby shower, so I had nearly a week to just hang out with my family - I even got to go wedding dress shopping with my sister-in-law!

I've been having some technical difficulties for the last few weeks, but we were finally able to spend some time last night fixing the issues (by we, I really mean Lee...) so I should be able to pick up my post frequency back up! I can't wait to post some of the things I've been working on!
