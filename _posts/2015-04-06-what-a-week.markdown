So my intentions to post a couple times a week went right out the window last week. I'm not sure what happened, but I was just silly busy in every part of my life. I did get several projects done though, including a set of 5 bibs for some ladies at a local nursing home and a custom laptop sleeve. Plus a couple of family birthday gifts, including the laptop sleeve below for my mother-in-law!

We had family in town this weekend for a combo Easter/birthday weekend. We had a really nice weekend and a surprisingly productive Saturday! Lee and I decided to spend a few hours cleaning out the fountain in our backyard that we had neglected for the entire winter. It looks so great now! We'd like to, at some point, knock out the center and make it a fire pit - we aren't big fountain people - but for now, we'll settle for it not being an eyesore (and mosquito breeding ground)! After we finished with that, Lee started on cleaning out the gutters, and my mother-in-law and I spent about 4 hours pulling weeds and trimming back the flower beds in our backyard! I forgot to take a before picture, but it is so much better back there! Oh, and our birdhouse has a bird nest in it!

This week I am playing catch up from last week. Finishing up projects for my sister and mom and playing around with a couple new ideas, plus finishing the flower beds out front, painting our front room, and a whole lot of cleaning.

My big win of the day was figuring out how to file my state sales tax for this quarter. May seem like a little thing, but I am seriously so proud of myself!
