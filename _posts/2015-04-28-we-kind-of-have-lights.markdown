It took most of the day Saturday for us to figure out what the heck we were doing, but we (and by we, I mean Lee with a small bit of assistance from me) managed to put up 2/3 of the wall sconces and our new entryway light. It was quite a learning experience for us (and by us, again, I mean mostly Lee...). Something we have definitely learned over our 6 months in this house is that while the previous owner seemed to really love this house and it is really good shape for being 19 years old... he definitely did things the easy, sloppy way. This became quite evident while we attempted to patch up the much larger than they needed to be holes where the sconces go (And touched up the several colors of paint around the ceiling in every room. And looked at the very weird wiring. I could go on...). Anyway, here are some pictures of the lights installed! We are still waiting on one more - it arrived damaged - and some lightbulbs, but we are so happy with how they look so far!

Also, check out this massive chandelier we took out of the entryway.

And now, look at picture of my husband pulling down said chandelier. I was very impressed with his method. I mean, I was initially terrified of his method, but it worked, so weâ€™ll go with impressed!

Other than that, not much new around here. Definitely looking forward to another weekend!
