I've been wanting to try Stitch Fix for a while, but just hadn't pulled the trigger. I decided a new job was a great time to update my wardrobe though! I'm counting my first box a huge success; I don't think I'll keep everything, but my stylist did a good job! Everything  fit well, and all but one item were things I'd probably pick out for myself. I have until Thursday to decide what I am keeping, so I'm still debating.


**Item #1**  
Juli Lasercut Detail Blouse ($48)

I really like this blouse! The color and pattern are right up my alley and the cut of the shirt is similar to others I own. I'm not always a huge fan of sleeveless shirts, but I'd likely pair this with a cardigan or jacket. I think I am probably keeping this one for sure.

**Item #2**  
Radka V-Neck Blouse ($44)

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 15px;">{% img img-responsive img-rounded /img/2016-05-10-stitch-fix-1/other_blouse.jpg %}</div>
  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 15px;">{% img img-responsive img-rounded /img/2016-05-10-stitch-fix-1/open_back.jpg %}</div>
</div>

I really like this shirt as well! Again with the sleeveless shirts, but I think the back is so much fun, and the pattern is just far enough out of my comfort zone without going crazy. I think I'll probably keep this one as well.

**Item #3**  
Joey Skinny Jean ($88)

These jeans are pictured above with both of the tops. These fit pretty well!  Magically, my stylist managed to send me pants that fit in both the waist and length on the first try. An impressive feat given I think I've only ever owned one pair that came from the store that way. I'm still on the fence about these. If these were any color but denim, I'd keep them in a heartbeat, but I'm pretty well set on jeans and I'm not sure I can justify the pricetag.

**Item #4**  
Millie Textured Knit Dress ($68)

{% img img-responsive img-rounded /img/2016-05-10-stitch-fix-1/dress.jpg %}

I really like this dress! I love a good fit and flare and the pattern on this one is so cute! And it is super soft and comfortable as well. My hesitation here is that I already have so many cute dresses that I rarely wear. I keep buying dresses because I love them, but I so rarely wear dresses anymore, so I'm not sure I can justify the price on this one either.

**Item #5**  
Gennie Knit Romper ($68)

{% img img-responsive img-rounded /img/2016-05-10-stitch-fix-1/romper.jpg %}

I so badly want to be a romper wearer, but I've yet to find one that I actually like how it fits. This is no exception. My sisters have both told me I should get out of my comfort zone with this one and keep it, but I'm still on the fence. The front is really what is putting me off. It is pretty much wide open from the waist, so I'd need to make some adjustments to be able to wear it out of the house. It is very comfortable, and I like the pattern, but I'm just not sure it is for me. I will, however, keep it if I decide to keep the pants and dress because after the 25% discount for buying the whole box, I end up spending less. Thoughts? 

I'm really happy with my first experience. I really liked that I had a few days to try things on in my own house and have time to think it over. I also was pretty impressed with my stylist's attention to my preferences. I made pretty good notes on my style profile and I also made a Pinterest board for her to refer to. In the note included in the box, she gave me specific reasons for choosing certain items based on my pins, which I thought was great!

Long story short, I loved the box, loved the experience, and I'm already looking forward to my next box! If you are interested in trying Stitch Fix out, [sign up here](https://www.stitchfix.com/referral/7321301) with my referral code!
