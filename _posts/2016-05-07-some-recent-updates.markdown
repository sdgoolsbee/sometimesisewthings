Well, so much for posting more often. The last several months have been interesting to say the least - some good, some bad - but I've been having a hard time wanting to write anything down. But the good news is that I have several posts I'm planning for this week, and I'm hoping to get into a regular rhythm now that my life will hopefully be settling down a bit.

Where to start... how about the job? I stopped working at Edgecase full-time in January, but continued on part-time from home until a few weeks ago. It has been kind of a bittersweet time, but I'm so excited to say that I am starting somewhere new next week! I accepted a position at Indeed and I start on May 16th! I'll share more details later, but I am so very excited about this opportunity!

Lee and I were able to take a vacation this past week! I'll do a separate post with some fun pictures, but here's the short version. We spent 3 days in NYC doing some fun touristy things and seeing a few late night shows and a broadway show, and then we took a 5 night cruise from New Jersey to Bermuda and back. It was such a fun, relaxing time for us and I am so glad we were able to have the time to do it!

I'm working on a few things for my store right now. I'll likely do a separate post at some point, but I am trying out a new inventory management system. I say new, but I've never really had one. Anyway, I'm doing a free trial of [Craftybase](https://craftybase.com/), and so far I like it. It is going to take me a while to actually add all of my materials, but I think it will definitely make things run more smoothly on my end. And hopefully cut down on the duplicate supply purchasing I tend to do... If you are interested in trying it out, use my referral code: [b7f2fa2b](https://craftybase.com/ref/b7f2fa2b) and we both get 10% off!

And then for some of the most exciting news recently, I am now a proud aunt to my first nephew, Luke! My middle sister Jessica and her husband had their first child on April 13, and he is perfect of course.

I may be biased, but seriously, is this not the sweetest face you have ever seen?

That is all I have for now, but I'm working on some more new posts for this week!
