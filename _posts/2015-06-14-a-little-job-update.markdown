The last few weeks have been a big adjustment for Lee and I. After ~7 months of me working part-time from home, going back to a full-time in the office job has been a big adjustment. I think once my body clock readjusts things will go a bit smoother, but other than being stinking exhausted pretty much every evening, I am loving it! 

Lee has worked for start-ups since he graduated from college; I've worked in retail and for a massive, global insurance broker, so our work experiences have been wildly different. He thinks the things I find surprising/enjoyable/exciting about my new office are hilarious. Things like meetings where we discuss things that could be done better and figure out ways to fix them. Oh and free snacks. Sidenote, I've worked in an office where Mexican coke is readily available for 3 weeks, and I've only had two. Be proud.

The job itself is going pretty well! It is taking me a little time to get my feet under me. As sad as it sounds, I'm having to use my brain in a different way than I have in a while. But the good news is, I am really enjoying it! Getting ready to start another week!
