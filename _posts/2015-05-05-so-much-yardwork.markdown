This is our first spring as homeowners and we have no idea what we are doing. Plus, I'm pretty sure most everything outside was neglected last spring because the previous owners knew they were selling. Those two things combined means it takes us forever to get anything done.

We recently became part of a new campus launch with our church that meets in a middle school; this means that we load all of our equipment in and out each week. As it gets warmer, we are all gross and sweaty once we are done at church, so we have been saving all of our yardwork for Sundays, because we might as well save all of our outside activities for then. That probably isn't going to last much longer, but it has been a pretty mild Texas spring. Anyway, we spent the last two Sundays in our front yard trimming the hedges, planting flowers, and mulching. I mean, I've been recovering for two days and it still hurts to move, but our house looks so much more loved! Now I just need to keep my plants alive through the summer and we will be good!

Before: (notice the giant bushes??)

After: The difference is way more noticable in person, but I love my pretty flowers!

Lee and I are taking a super last minute trip to visit family in Georgia next week. We've been saying we were going to go in the spring for several months and never really picked a time. Because of Lee's work schedule, we realized we either need to go now or wait a couple months, so now it is! We are really looking forward to getting out of town for a little bit. We're leaving Friday to spend the weekend in DFW celebrating my sister-in-law's college graduation (and Mother's Day!) and then we'll drive to Georgia to spend a couple days with Lee's grandparents, a couple days with some of my family and then a couple days somewhere else (we are thinking Chattanooga?). Yay vacation!
