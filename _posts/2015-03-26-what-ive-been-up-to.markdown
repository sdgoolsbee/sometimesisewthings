So the idea for this blog began last year, and the first post was written on January 1 when I asked my husband to help me out with creating a website. I should have known that my super-busy-with-real-work (web developer) husband would be quite the overacheiver :) (And take quite a while to finish the project, but I so happy with the results that we'll forget about that part!) For now, I plan to add a couple of posts a week, but I am sure my vision will change over time.

Lee took Friday off last week and we went back to Dallas for a visit since we had not been since before Christmas. I think this is the first visit in at least a few years that wasn't for a specific reason or event. We had such a nice time hanging out with our families without really having much of an agenda. Plus, I got an awesome hair cut and color from my super talented little sister [Jessica](https://www.facebook.com/jessicam.norvell?fref=ts) and got to enjoy a pedicure with my mom and grandma. Great long weekend!

This past week has been a pretty big week for adding things to my store. There's a link on the right side of this page and you can check out all my new listings! I've added some new elastic hair-ties, a few new headbands, a computer sleeve, and a set of placemats. Another new set of placemats should be up sometime this weekend. I am forgetful and missing the correct color thread to finish it up, so it won't be today. Oops. 

I've been ::cough cough:: really behind on other projects that I committed to, so the next few days are going to be very full! I have completed one set of curtains for my mom today (requested for her birthday last November... yes I'm embarrassed) and the second set is in the works. I'm also working on a backpack for my youngest sister Katie.

I am using [this tutorial](http://pinoyinoz.blogspot.com/2008/07/tutorial-city-backpack.html) with a few tweaks and am really excited about how it will turn out! This is my "stretch" project right now. I've only made a few bags and this looks like a fun one to try out!

In other news, I'm trying really really hard not to get sick. Pretty sure it's all just allergies â€“ thank you Austin.
