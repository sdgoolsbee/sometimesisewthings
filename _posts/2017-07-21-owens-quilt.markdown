As you can see, this post has been a long time coming. I started on a quilt for Owen in July (when he was about 3 months old). I finished it in November (when he was about 7 months old). I wanted to share some pictures of my progress and the final product, and also share the tutorials I used to make it. It definitely took longer than it would have a couple years ago, since it is hard to get any solid project time with a cute baby to play with (and feed... and generally take care of...), but I got it done! 

I used [this tutorial](https://weallsew.com/how-to-make-a-minky-backed-baby-quilt/) in 2016 to make a quilt for my nephew when he was born.

I loved how it turned out, so I made a pretty similar one for Owen, with a few minor changes. First, I made the squares 1/2" larger. This was honestly just due to laziness. The tutorial calls for 5 1/2" squares, but I have a 6"x24" ruler, so cutting 6" squares was much quicker for me. It meant I used slightly more batting and minky fabric, but as I had plenty of both, it wasn't an issue.

# Materials:
- **Quilt**
    - Rotary cutter, ruler and mat
    - 1/2 yard of 6 coordinating fabrics
    - 1 1/4 yards coordinating Minky fabric
    - Cotton batting - Baby Quilt size (34″ x 45″)
    - Temporary adhesive/repositionable spray basting (such as Spray N’ Bond)
- **Appliqué**
    - 1/4 yard fabric
    - [Heat n' Bond](http://www.joann.com/heat-n-bond-ultra-hold-iron-on-adhesive-17inx12in/1069806.html)

I assembled my quilt per the instructions in the tutorial linked above.

The other change I made was to use my Cricut to cut out letters to appliqué. I am so happy with how it turned out! I had never cut fabric with my Cricut before, and I [used this tutorial](http://www.freshlemonsquilts.com/cutting-fabric-using-a-cricut-explore-air/) as a guide.

The font I used was 'Hiragino Kaku Gothic Std'. I made the letters right at 3" tall, which made them the perfect size to fit on the squares.

</div>

After I used the Heat n' Bond to adhere the letters where I wanted them, I used an appliqué stitch to stitch them in place.

  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 15px;">{% img img-responsive img-rounded /img/2017-07-21-owens-quilt/quilt7.jpg %}</div>
  <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 15px;">{% img img-responsive img-rounded /img/2017-07-21-owens-quilt/quilt8.jpg %}</div>
</div>

Once my letters were in place, I finished my quilt using the instructions in the tutorial.

I love how it turned out! The fabric on the backside is so soft, but the quilt itself is a little stiff still. Owen and I snuggle with it at night when we're getting ready for bed; and the more we use it, the more pliable it gets. I hope it lasts him a very long time!
