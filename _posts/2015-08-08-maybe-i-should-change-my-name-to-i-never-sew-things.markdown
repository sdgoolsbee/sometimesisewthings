Wow. It has been nearly 3 months since my last post. Time has definitely gotten away from me! This post has been in progress for a month as you can see by the date, so a more up to date post will follow soon!

I still love my job. I'm starting to feel like I know what is going on. But only kind of. Lee and I are still enjoying working together, which is great. It is fun to be able to bounce work related things off each other and have insight into each others jobs. It is still a little weird working at the same place - especially since it is such a small office - but it is also a lot of fun!

I took a few days off in July to go on a whirlwind roadtrip with my family to visit my uncle in Indiana for his 50th birthday. I'm not kidding when I say whirlwind. I left Austin on a Thursday morning (on the Megabus! What a weird adventure!) and spent the afternoon in DFW with my mom, grandma, sister, and cousin at iFly. We left bright and early Friday morning for a full day of driving from Dallas to Huntingburg, Indiana. We took a short detour to Memphis for lunch - yum! - and made it to my uncle's house to surprise him about 9pm. Saturday, some of us spent the day at Holiday World (or Hell as some of us refer to it), while everyone else went to a casino.

Sunday we went to my Aunt and Uncle's church and then took a dubious adventure to Santa Claus, IN, where we climbed on signs, bought a lot of Christmas ornaments, and met the creepiest Santa Claus ever.

We drove back to Dallas on Monday and then I caught the Megabus back to Austin on Tuesday. It was a really great trip, and I enjoyed getting to spend time with my sister and cousins, but it was quite a whirlwind. 

Beyond that, Lee has been doing a few things around the house. We have LED lights in nearly every room now, which is a huge accomplishment because of rooms like our kitchen where there are 9 (yes, 9) recessed lights. And we also have new mirrors and shelves in our bathroom. Hopefully faucets will follow soon and our little mini remodel in there will be done. 

We also had couches delivered for our front room last week! We've been enjoying hanging out in there - and feeling a little more grown up with our first major non-IKEA furniture purchases!
