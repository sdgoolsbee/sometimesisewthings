Some of you may remember that I left my full-time job in November. For the last 6 months or so, I've been working part time from home for Edgecase, the company Lee works for, while getting settled in our house and working on my Etsy store. Well, things are changing! 

I've accepted a full-time position as a Strategist for Edgecase, and I am so very excited! I wasn't necessarily planning to go back to work full-time right now, but everything has really come together perfectly. Lee sent me the job listing a few months ago when the position opened because he thought it would be a good fit for me. Several interviews and a good bit of waiting later, I start tomorrow! It is going to be an interesting transition for sure, not only because I will be back to working outside the home all day, but also because Lee and I will be working in the same office. We aren't on the same team, but it is an office of less than 40 people, so we will be close by.

I am so excited about what comes next. And nervous. But very excited!
