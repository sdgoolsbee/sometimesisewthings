I’m alive! 

It has been a crazy busy few months and I’m not sure things will slow down anytime soon! Lee and I are doing well! We were mega busy right up until Christmas, so we took a few days and escaped to a cabin in the hill country for a couple days for New Years. We had such a nice and relaxing time. We were able to spend time reflecting on the 2015 and talking about goals and plans for 2016, but we mostly just sat in front of the fireplace and relaxed.

I set some loose goals for myself business-wise last year (you can read some of them in my first post [here](http://sometimesisewthings.com/2015/03/15/here-goes-nothing/)) and I’ve done the same this year. 

- I’ve been open for about a year and a half and am sitting at 95 sales. I’d like to hit 200 (stretch goal of 250) by the end of 2016.
- Last year I wanted to try my hand at a in-person craft show. I did one in November and it went pretty well! (I made nearly 1/4 of my last year’s sales in one day! Not bad for my first attempt with my super part-time Etsy store!) This year I’d like to do two. Baby steps! Heres a picture of my booth:

- And then just more of the same with regards to adding new products, building inventory, and improving my online presence. I have some fun ideas for a few new products, so now I just need time to build up inventory of them and get them listed.

I'm going to attempt to not disappear again! I'll be posting my progress on some of my new projects soon!
