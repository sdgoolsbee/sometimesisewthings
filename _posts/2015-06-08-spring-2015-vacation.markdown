Lee and I went on vacation a few weeks ago and I thought I’d post a little recap. [Lee posted a bunch of pictures on his flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlgoolsbee/albums/72157651594147394/), but here are a few highlights!

We started the trip in Dallas for Lee’s sister’s college graduation and Mother’s Day. It was a really great weekend of family time and celebration!

On Sunday afternoon, we started our trek towards Georgia. We stopped in Vicksburg, Mississippi for the night and then continued on the next morning to Concord, GA, where Lee’s grandparents live. They live on a massive tree farm, which is beautiful, and in the middle of nowhere. We spent a few days relaxing, refreshing, and visiting – well, I did anyways; Lee helped his granddad with a bunch of stuff, like changing the tire on his tractor – before heading north to Marietta, GA.

My grandparents recently moved from Houston to Marietta to live with my Aunt and Uncle so we got to visit with all of them. We spent some time helping my grandparents get a few things set up, but we mostly just visited. We also spent a few hours at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens - it is beautiful and relaxing and I would highly recommend it.

Because I knew I would be starting a new job soon, we decided very last minute to take the trip to Gerogia. Our original plan was to visit family and maybe go somewhere else for a night or two, but we never really made that part of the plan. The night before we left Marietta, we booked a hotel on the beach in Orange Beach, AL and headed there for two nights. It was a great end to our vacation (minus the sunburns…)! Our room overlooked the beach and we spent pretty much the whole time laying out on the beach. We even rented an umbrella that covered us the entire day so don’t ask me why we are both still peeling 3 weeks later. We ate yummy seafood, relaxed on the beach, and played in the ocean. Okay, Lee played in the ocean. I got knocked over by a few too many waves and swallowed a bunch of saltwater and then gave up on playing in the ocean.

We took our time getting home from Alabama; we stopped for beignets at Cafe du Monde and an end-of-vacation/Stephanie-got-a-job dinner at Taste of Texas in Houston, and then spent our last night of vacation at a hotel in Katy, TX. We were only a few hours from home, but we just couldn’t push any further.

Overall, it was such a relaxing vacation. Not a whole lot of activities, mostly just enjoying each other’s company and the company of our families!

Since we’ve been back, we have been going full steam ahead. I’ll post an update about those changes in a few days!
