We’ve been in our house for nearly 6 months now and have only made a few minor changes. We wanted to live here for a little while and see how we felt before we really tried to make it our own. Our first larger project is our living/dining room area. We’ve been formulating a plan for a a few months and we are just now starting to put it in place. This room is at the very front of our house, so we want it to be welcoming and comfortable for us to relax in and also be a nice place to host family, our small group, etc. We got a hand-me-down dining room set from my grandparents from about 1970 a few months ago and have picked out some fabric to recover the chairs with. We are also starting to funish the living room area as we find things we like. Here is where we started:

We are also planning to replace some of the light fixtures with something a little more our style, and a couple of the blinds that are inexplicably a different color. The previous owner was an electrician and we think he got good discounts on leftover fixtures, so we are working with 3 completely different styles in this one room alone. We've been looking for months and are thinking about replacing the 3 sconces and entryway light with fixtures along this line.

Over the past few weeks, we have been attempting to paint (in our spare time - HA!). The 3 walls that mostly surround the space have been a beautiful blue for two weeks now, but we have been struggling to find time to paint the contrasting wall. We finally did on Friday night, and after weeks of staring at the sample swatch on the wall and just waiting for us to have an evening free to paint, it was the wrong stinking color: way way way too blue (we were going for a more neutral grey). We found a new color yesterday and should be able to paint it tomorrow night. What a mess.

On my sewing table right now are these awesome braided leather headbands that will be listed later this evening and the first set of curved placemats (for round tables) I’ve sold through my store!! I get a lot of great feedback on them, but so far I haven't sold any, so I was very excited to receive that order on Thursday!
