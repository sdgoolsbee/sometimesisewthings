My name is Stephanie and I live in Round Rock, Texas with my husband and our two cats. We've been married for a little over 7 years and are expecting our first child in the Spring!

The name of my site pretty much says it all. Sometimes I sew. But lately, “sometimes” has become more infrequent with pregnancy exhaustion and my work schedule. My vision for this blog is not only to share about our lives, but also to be able to share items from my Etsy store and other projects I am working on.

I opened my Etsy store, Sometimes I Sew Things, in July of 2014. I am still working on my "niche" so to speak, but I realized that if I didn't just jump in, I never would. Right now, I’m running on already made inventory only as I just haven’t had the time or energy after work to get more things made. Hopefully that will change before too long!
