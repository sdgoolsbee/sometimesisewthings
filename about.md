My name is Stephanie and I live in Round Rock, Texas with my husband and our two cats. We've been married for about five and a half years and just moved into our first home! 

I have never considered myself a very crafty person. At all. A few years ago, I randomly decided I need to learn how to sew. My grandma sews, and my mom and sisters all learned at some point, but I never did. I took a few classes on the basics and was just figuring out my machine when we picked up and moved to London. I bought a new machine over there and spent much of my time in London exploring and teaching myself how to cook and sew.

I opened my shop, Sometimes I Sew Things, in July of 2014. I am still working on my "niche" so to speak, but I realized that if I didn't just jump in, I never would. 

The name pretty much says it all. Sometimes I sew. But that is not all I do. My vision for this blog is not only to be able to share items from my store and other sewing projects I am working on, but also to share other things about our lives. We just moved into a new house, and I'd like to share our journey towards making this house our home, as well as whatever else comes to mind.
